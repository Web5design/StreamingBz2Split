Streaming BZip2 Splitter
------------------------

This tool has been written by me to solve Hadoop's problem. Hadoop cannot split bz2 files until 0.23. Some folks attempted to backport the patch to
Hadoop 20 but its not stable, not available.

This is a simple tool which given one/more bz2 files, uses the bzip tools to split it into multiple smaller files. The size of the smaller chunks/number
of chunks to split can be configured. During splitting, the tool ensures that records are properly split among the chunks, i.e. a single record is only
available in one of the chunks and this is specially taken care. It can work only if the record boundary is '\n'. The splitting happens fast even for
large text files because it does not attempt to decompress the whole file, instead it only decompresses parts of the file required to handle record
boundaries.

Works with:
	Text files, bz2 compressed and record boundary '\n'

Generates:
	Smaller files with same data but gzip compressed.

We use bzip2recover and generate smaller files and concatenate them into larger files. Now Hadoop does not understand such files and reads only a
smaller portion of them. So, to fix them the bzip2 header of the chunks should be fixed. Thats a little tricky and to get around the problem, I
bunzip them (yes bzip tools understand such formats) and gzip them - both of them are pretty fast.

Drivers have been written to run the same logic on multiple files using Hadoop Streaming. The scripts takes a directory of bz2 files, splits them
based on size/chunks, verifies them and launches another job to gzip them. All along, the number of mappers can be controlled.

Here is a sample usage of the script:

[thiruvel@localhost StreamingBz2Split]$ ./run.sh -h

./run.sh: [-t] [-c <chunk size> | -n <number of chunks>] [-v] [-m no_maps] -i input_dir -o output_dir
        -t - Verify integrity of the input bzip2 files. OFF by default.
        -c - Chunk size of each bzip2 split in MB, final size of gzip files may vary. 4 by default.
        -n - Number of chunks to be generated, mutually exclusive to -c. Disabled by default.
        -v - Verify rowcounts between input and output - OFF by default.
        -m - Number of Maps to be launched, default number of maps = number of files.
        -i - Input dir. The directory should exist and contain bz2 files. Other files will be ignored.
        -o - Output dir. The directory will be cleaned if it exists and the output split files in .gz
             format will be placed here. It will also be used as a scratch directory.
        -h - Print usage

FAQ:
----
1. Is there any way to turn off the verbosity?
Set DEBUG env. variable to 0 and run the script.

2. Is there no other way to read bz2 files in Hadoop without this script?
Pig can read and process bz2 files in parallel, but the limitation is that the data should be on a directory whose name should end with '.bz2'.
Not many directories on HDFS are in this format and it would have been nice if Pig supports a way to use a regular directory with bz2 files with a knob.



Start using this script at your own risk - tools provided to validate data and you can use your own validators too.

Please email me your feedbacks if any.

Thanks!
